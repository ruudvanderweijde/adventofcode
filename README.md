Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Disclaimer

I'm solving these puzzles mainly for entertainment. Once the puzzle is solved, I'm not doing any refactoring or clean up.
The reason is that this code does not need to be maintainable. There is not much need to revisit the code later on.
